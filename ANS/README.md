This file contains the code and test images for an approximate number system test which tests your ability to "guesstimate" the number of objects shwon in a non-symbolic number comparison task.
To run this test you will need to download the ANS V1 jupyter file and all of the images in this folder, and run all of these files together in the same file in jupyter.
